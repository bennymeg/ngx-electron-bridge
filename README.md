## About The Project

Isolated context bridge library for Electron & Angular applications.

## Getting Started

This project work with Electron application that are powered by Angular. We suggest using [Nx Electron](https://github.com/bennymeg/nx-electron) for this purpose.

### Installation

```sh
npm install ngx-electron-bridge
```

## Usage

1. expose you desired context in the main process
```ts
    import { ipcMain } from 'electron';
    import { ContextBridgeService } from 'ngx-electron-bridge';

    ContextBridgeService.addIpcBridge("myExposedFunctionSignature", "my-exposed-function");
    ContextBridgeService.expose();

    ipcMain.handle("my-exposed-function", (event, ...args) => {
        console.log(args);
    });
```

2. invoke the exposed context in your renderer process
```ts
import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { ElectronBridge } from 'ngx-window-bridge';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss']
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(@Inject(ElectronBridge) _electronBridge: any) {
    _electronBridge.myExposedFunctionSignature(...args);
  }
}
```
